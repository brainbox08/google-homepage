This is my first official project with The Odin Academy.
I am going to replicate the Google homepage,
essentially from <strong>scratch</strong>.
Wish me well!

Edit:
During this project I have learned a number of important skills,
and I have committed to both brain and muscle memory a range of others.
I have learned how to use the grid template function and have made good use
of Google to figure out things that caught me out.
